<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Cami</h1>

### Here is a little bit more about me

I am a frontend software engineer that is passionate about Technology and wants to work to positively impact the world.

I always knew I wanted to be ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù helping people create and learn new things. That motivation led me to the customer service path. I chose to learn two languages so I could translate texts, conversations and information to people.
I loved the opportunities that I had in the hospitality industry where I could explain and translate information to people in their first language and perfect my problem solving skills. Eventually I felt that there were some limitations in the customer service industry and I decided to look for something different.
After some exploration, I found that I could help people in a new way by bringing their personal/business ideas to life (combining my love for learning new languages and helping people) through code.
I aim to continue helping people by providing them with all my creative and technical skills. It is a joy to build something from the ground up using something as abstract as lines of characters.

Aside from my professional work, I am a very creative person that likes to draw, make collages, take pictures and visit museums.
